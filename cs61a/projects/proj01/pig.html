<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple
    strategies for the game of Pig. You will need to implement some
    higher-order functions, experiment with random number generators,
    and generate some ASCII art.</p>

<p>
    Pig is a dice game with simple rules: Two players take turns rolling
    dice and scoring points until one player reaches 100 points. Each
    turn has a <strong>turn total</strong>, which is a tentative number of points
    the player has accumulated so far during the turn (this is different
    from the <strong>turn score</strong>, which is what the player <em>actually</em>
    scores at the end of the turn). A player's <strong>turn</strong> consists of a
    sequence of actions. There are two legal actions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>
            <strong>roll</strong>: If the player rolls a
        </p></li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1: the player scores 1 point and it becomes the
                opponent's turn.</p></li>
        <li><p>anything else: the roll is added to the player's
                turn total, and the turn continues.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p>
            <strong>hold</strong>: The player scores the turn total
            and it becomes the opponent's turn.
        </p></li>
</ul>

<p>
    A player's turn will end if (a) the player rolls a 1, or (b) the
    player holds. Otherwise, the <strong>outcome</strong> of each roll will be
    added to the turn total, and the player can once again choose to
    roll or hold.
</p>

<p>
    Someone has posted a <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVIvB-ahI4A">Pig
    instructional video</a>. Note that they give 0 points to a turn that
    ends in a roll of 1, while we give 1 point.
</p>

<p>
    In this project, you will create a variant of Pig that uses two
    different dice. Players roll a 6-sided die, unless the <em>sum of
    the scores</em> of both players is a multiple of 7 (0 included), in
    which case they roll a 4-sided die. This sum of scores <em>does
    not</em> include the turn total.
</p>

<p>
    In the later parts of this project, you will be creating various plans
    to play the game. We will use two terms: <strong>strategy</strong>
    and <strong>tactic</strong>. Think of a strategy as a plan for the
    entire game. In contrast, a tactic is a plan for a single turn; it
    determines what actions the player should choose in that specific turn.
    A strategy is essentially a repertoire of tactics; each player enters
    the game with a single strategy, and each turn a player picks a suitable
    tactic from their strategy.
</p>

<p>
    In terms of code, a <code>strategy</code> is a <em>higher-order
    function</em> that returns a <code>tactic</code> function to respond
    to the current game state. A <code>tactic</code> is itself a
    higher-order function that returns an <strong>action</strong> (either a
    <code>roll</code> function or a <code>hold</code> function).
</p>

<p>
    This project includes three files, but all of your changes will be
    made to the first one. You can download all of the project code as a
    <a href="proj01.zip">zip archive</a>.

<h3>Logistics</h3>

<p>This is a two-week project. You are expected to complete this
    project individually - no partners are allowed. However, you will
    have a project partner for the final two projects.</p>

<p>Start early! The amount of time it takes to complete a project
    (or any program) is unpredictable. Ask for help early and often --
    the TAs and lab assistants are here to help.</p>

<p>The project is worth 15 points. To avoid fractions, however, we
    have assigned "inflated" points that add up to 25. We will simply
    weight the grading calculation by multiplying the nominal score you
    receive by 0.6.</p>

<p>
    The only file that you are required to submit is the file called
    <code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code>. You do not need to modify any other files to
    complete the project. To submit the project, change to the directory
    where the pig.py file is located and run <code>submit proj1</code>.
    We will set up an autograder that runs your code through different
    test cases and sends out the results in an e-mail.
<p>

<p>
    For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
    initial code that we give you. This is solely designed to 
    help you get started: if you would rather not use the provided
    code snippet, feel free to delete it and start from scratch.
</p>

<p>
    However, you may <strong>not</strong> modify any other functions.
    Doing so  may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
    Also, do not change the function signatures (argument order,
    number of arguments).
</p>

<h3>Phase 1: Simulator</h3>

<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game and
    a basic strategy.</p>

<p>The first step in implementing a Pig simulator is to specify the
    rules of the game. You will implement each of the legal actions.
    Remember that a turn consists of a sequence of actions and ends
    either when a player rolls a 1 or holds. Read the comments of the
    functions you are implementing, as they specify the precise behavior
    expected.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 1</strong> (2 pt). First, implement the <code>roll</code> function
    in <code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code>, which computes the result of rolling a
    particular outcome. Remember that no points are scored unless the
    turn ends! On successful (greater than 1) rolls, points are only
    accumulated in the turn total.
</p>

<p>
    Then, implement the <code>hold</code> function
    in <code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code>, which computes the result of holding.
    Holding actually doesn't care about the dice outcome. Nonetheless,
    this argument is provided so that <code>hold</code> has the same
    signature as <code>roll</code>. Similarly, <code>hold</code> must
    return a turn total even though the result is irrelevant to the
    game. Always return a turn total of 0.
</p>

<p>
    You can verify your work by checking that the <strong>doctests</strong>
    for <code>roll</code> and <code>hold</code> pass. To do this, run the
    following line from your terminal:
    
<pre>
      python3 -m doctest pig.py
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Notice that <code>roll</code> and <code>hold</code> are not the only functions 
    checked. In future problems, you can check your work on problems
    that provide doctests by running the line of code above in your
    terminal.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Problem 2</strong> (2 pt). Implement the <code>take_turn</code>
    function, which simulates a complete turn that may include multiple
    rolls. This function takes a <code>tactic</code> as an argument,
    which itself is a function (see next paragraph). The return value of
    <code>take_turn</code> is the <strong>turn score</strong>, the total number of
    points the player scored at the end of the turn.
</p>

<p>
    A <code>tactic</code> is a higher-order function that takes one
    integer argument, the current <code>turn_total</code>, and returns
    one of the two functions: either <code>roll</code> or <code>hold</code>,
    both of which you implemented in Problem 1. A <code>tactic</code> is a
    turn-specific plan that determines which action the player will
    choose based on the current <code>turn_total</code>.
</p>

<p>
    A <code>dice</code> is also a function. (We would call it a "die",
    but that's too morbid). It takes no arguments and returns an
    integer: the outcome of a die roll.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Important</em>: Your implementation of <code>take_turn</code>
    should always call the <code>dice</code> function <em>exactly
    once</em> for every action, including <code>hold</code>. If you don't
    do this, various tests will break later in the project!
</p>

<p>
    For now, you can ignore the arguments <code>who</code> and
    <code>comments</code>, which you will use later.
</p>

<p>
    Try testing your <code>take_turn</code> (via 
    <code>take_turn_test</code>) by issuing the following command at
    the terminal:

<pre>    python3 pig.py --take_turn_test </pre>

    In shorthand, you can also issue:
<pre>    python3 pig.py -t </pre>
    
    <em>Note</em>: This is not the <strong>doctest</strong>, but a
    convenient tool to help run tests. You still need to run doctests
    to debug your code. 
</p>
<p>
    The tactic that is provided by default will <code>roll</code> until
    the turn total reaches at least 10, and then <code>hold</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Hint</em>: We have provided some tools in <code><a href="ucb.py.html">ucb.py</a></code> to
    help you understand what is happening in your code. If you decorate
    a function with <code>@trace</code>, then a line of output will be
    printed every time that function is called. If you call <code>log_current_line()</code>,
    then the current line number will be printed. Finally, if you call <code>interact()</code>,
    then you will receive an interactive prompt in the current
    environment.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 3</strong> (1 pt). Implement a better <code>take_turn_test</code>,
    which validates the correctness of your <code>take_turn</code>
    implementation. To do so, read the <code><a href="dice.py.html">dice.py</a></code> file,
    which provides a function called <code>make_test_die</code>. Test
    dice are not random like regular dice. Instead, you can specify the
    exact sequence of outcomes returned by successive rolls. The
    docstring for <code>make_test_die</code> shows examples.
</p>

<p>
    Using <code>assert</code> statements, test that the default tactic
    scores exactly 10 points when rolling a 4, 6, 1. Add additional
    tests to ensure that the tactic gives expected outcomes with various
    roll sequences.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 4</strong> (1 pt). Change the default value for <code>comments</code>
    in <code>take_turn</code> from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>.
    Then, call <code>commentate</code> after the result of each action
    is computed, whenever <code>comments</code> is <code>True</code>. You
    will need to read the docstring for <code>commentate</code> to make
    this call correctly.
</p>

<p>
    After you start calling the <code>commentate</code> function, you
    should see a transcript of events when you run <code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code>,
    which includes statements like "<code>Someone did something... Someone
    now has a turn total of 7 points.</code>" Details of the game events are
    currently rather vague.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 5</strong> (2 pt). You will now implement <code>describe_action</code>,
    which takes an action function and returns a string describing that
    action. Edit the body of <code>describe_action</code> so that its
    doctest passes. For any action that is not <code>roll</code> or <code>hold</code>,
    the commentator should announce that an illegal action was taken.
</p>

<p>
    When you are finished, the doctest for <code>describe_action</code>
    should pass, and your commentary should have informative action
    messages when you run <code>take_turn</code> with <code>comments</code>
    set to <code>True</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Hint</em>: You can figure out what a function is without calling
    it, using <code>==</code> .
<p>
    <strong>Problem 6</strong> (2 pt). You will now implement <code>draw_number</code>,
    which draws the outcome of a die using text symbols. Such pictures
    are called <em>ASCII art</em>.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Note</em>: The sides with 2 and 3 dots have 2 possible depictions due to
          rotation. Either representation is acceptable. 

</p>

<p>
    The drawing facility is actually written for you in <code>draw_die</code>.
    However, it uses a bunch of Python syntax that we haven't yet
    covered! You'll have to use this function as a black box, just by
    reading its docstring. Programming often involves using other
    people's code by reading the documentation.
</p>

<p>
    When you are finished, the doctest for <code>draw_number</code>
    should pass, and your commentary should produce ASCII dice pictures
    when you call <code>take_turn</code> with <code>comments</code>
    equal to <code>True</code>.
</p>

<p>You're almost ready to implement a full game of Pig!</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 7</strong> (2 pt). First, implement <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code>.
    This is a higher-order function that returns ("makes") a <em>strategy</em>.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Strategies</em>: Recall that a strategy is like a "game plan" that
    holds a set of tactics. Depending on the player's score and the
    opponent's score (i.e. if the player is winning or not), the player
    will choose a specific tactic to use during this turn. In terms of
    code, a <code>strategy</code> is a higher-order function that takes
    two arguments: the player's score and the opponent's score, and
    returns a <code>tactic</code> function.
</p>

<p>
    Note that <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code> itself is not the
    strategy, but a function that returns a strategy.
</p>

<p>
    Your implementation of <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code> will
    return a <em>very</em> simple strategy: so simple that it will 
    effectively ignore its two arguments. This simple strategy will 
    return a tactic that always chooses to roll unless the specified
    <code>turn_total</code> goal has been reached. In other words, the
    strategy that <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code> returns will 
    <strong>roll until</strong> it reaches a certain <code>turn_total</code>.
</p>

<p>Run the doctest to verify your work.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 8</strong> (3 pt). Finally, implement the <code>play</code>
    function, which simulates a full game of Pig. Players alternate
    turns, each using the tactic returned by their own strategy
    function, until one of the players reaches the goal score. When the
    game ends, <code>play</code> should return 0 if the first player
    wins, and 1 otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Remember that you must supply the correct
    die to the <code>take_turn</code> function. For every turn, check if
    the sum of both players' scores is divisible by 7. If it is, you must
    supply a 4-sided die. If not, you supply a 6-sided die as usual.
</p>

<p>
    As you work, you can add <code>print</code> statements and
    use <code>@trace</code> to see what is happening in your code.
</p>

<p>
    To test your implementation, enter the following line from
    your terminal to start an interactive game of Pig:
</p>

<pre>
      python3 pig.py --play
</pre>

<p>Congratulations! You have finished Phase 1 of this project!</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Strategies</h3>

<p>
    In this final phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon
    the basic strategy. To do this, you will first implement a
    small framework for testing strategy functions against the
    roll-until strategy. We will use the strategy returned by
    <code>make_roll_until_strategy(20)</code>
    as a baseline upon which we hope to improve.
</p>

<em>Note</em>: You will want to set the default of <code>comments</code>
back to <code>False</code> in the definition of <code>take_turn</code>,
so that you are not overwhelmed with output.

<p>
    <strong>Problem 9</strong> (2 pt). Implement the <code>make_average</code>
    function. This higher-order function takes a function <code>fn</code>
    as an argument, and returns another function that takes the same
    number of arguments as the original. It is different from the
    original function in that it returns the average value of 
    repeatedly calling
    <code>fn</code> on its arguments. This function should call <code>fn</code>
    a total of <code>num_samples</code> times and return the average of
    their results.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Note:</em> If the input function <code>fn</code> is not a pure
    function (for instance, the <code>random</code> function), then
    <code>make_average</code> will also not be a pure function.
</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python
    syntax! You must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number
    of arguments, then calls another function using exactly those
    arguments. Here's how it works.</p>

<p>
    Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, we write <code>*args</code>.
    To call another function using exactly those arguments, we call it
    again with <code>*args</code>. For example,
</p>

<pre>
      &gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
              def print_and_return(*args):
                  result = fn(*args)
                  print('Result:', result)
                  return result
              return print_and_return
      &gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
      &gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
      Result: 256
      256
</pre>

<p>
    Read the docstring for <code>make_average</code> carefully to
    understand how it is meant to work.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 10</strong> (2 pt). This problem is about understanding code
    and designing your first experiment.
    Read <code>compare_strategies</code> and <code>eval_strategy_range</code>
    and understand what it is doing. You will use these functions to answer
    the following question:
</p>
<p>
    Recall that a <code>roll_until</code> strategy (from <strong>Problem 6</strong>)
    will keep choosing the <code>roll</code> action until it 
    reaches its <code>turn_goal</code>. Within the range
    15 to 25 (inclusive), which value of <code>turn_goal</code> 
    achieves the best win rate? 
</p>
<p>
    In <code>run_strategy_experiments</code>,
    use <code>eval_strategy_range</code> to find the best <code>turn_total</code>.
    You should compare your <code>roll_until</code> strategies against the
    baseline strategy, which <code>eval_strategy_range</code> already does.
    Print out what <code>eval_strategy_range</code>
    determined was the best value.
</p>

<p>
    To test <code>run_strategy_experiments()</code>, go to the terminal
    and enter the following:
</p>

<pre>
      python3 pig.py --run_strat_exps
</pre>

<p>
    Now you will implement three strategies that improve upon the
    baseline. Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run.
    You can always reduce the number of random samples in <code>make_average</code>
    to speed up experiments.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Tip</em>: If you forgot to change the <code>comments</code> to
    <code>False</code> in <code>take_turn</code>, running 
    <code>run_strategy_experiments</code> will result in hundreds of
    lines of output to the terminal, which may result in the process
    taking much longer. You can terminate the Python process by doing
    <code>Ctrl-C</code>. In general, issuing a <code>Ctrl-C</code>
    will try to terminate the active process.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 11</strong> (2 pt). Implement the <code>make_die_specific_strategy</code>
    function. This function takes two turn goals, <code>four_side_goal</code>
    and <code>six_side_goal</code>, and returns a new strategy that
    checks to see which die is being used (either 4-sided or 6-sided)
    and returns a roll-until tactic that stops at the corresponding turn
    goal. Keep in mind that a four-sided die is only used when the sum
    of your score and your opponent's score is divisible by 7. The idea
    here is that holding early with a 4-sided die avoids 1's.
</p>

<p>
    Add an experiment to <code>run_strategy_experiments</code> that
    evaluates different turn goals for a 4-sided die, in the range 5 to
    15.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 12</strong> (2 pt). Implement the <code>make_pride_strategy</code>,
    which only stops rolling when two conditions are true: the turn
    total is at least <code>turn_goal</code> and the player's score
    after holding is at least <code>margin</code> greater than the
    opponent. The idea here is that riskier rolling is justified when a
    player is behind.
</p>

<p>
    Add an experiment to <code>run_strategy_experiments</code> that
    evaluates different margins for your new strategy, in the range 0 to
    10.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Problem 13</strong> (2 pt). Implement <code>final_strategy</code>,
    which combines these ideas and others to achieve a win rate of at
    least 0.60 against the baseline roll-until-20 strategy. Here are
    some hints:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Think about what happens when you only need 10 more points
        to win, but are using a roll-until-20 strategy. Can you improve
        end-game performance?</li>

    <li>Rolling until 20 is a very bad idea when given a 4-sided die.
        Can you give your opponent more bad dice?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You're implementing a strategy function directly here, as opposed to
    a function that returns a strategy. If your win rate is usually
    (i.e., half the time) above 0.60, you have answered the question
    successfully. You can test this entering the following line in
    your terminal:
</p>

<pre>
      python3 pig.py --final_strat_test
</pre>

<p>
    <em>Note</em>: This test can take a couple of seconds to complete.
</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS61A
    project!</p>
